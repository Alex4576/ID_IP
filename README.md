<h1>SPECIFICALLYRETRO</h1> 
<p>Our website is an ecommerce website which aims to market towards people who enjoy the collection of both vintage and retro musical items. Through features like auctions, they can purchase items which are rarer and exquisite, catering to richer and more dedicated enthusiasts. For people who just wish to purchase regular items, we also provide budget friendly options. We also provide services like selling your retro items to us, for those who have lost interest in the hobby, or just want more cash to purchase another product they like.<p> 
  
  
<h2>Design Process</h2> 
<p>For this website, we wanted to follow the same minimalist aesthetic of our app from figma. Therefore we used the same type of buttons, and same ype of backgrounds. 
WHO THIS WEBSITE IS FOR: Targets users who wish to purchase musical items which can no longer be found in normal stores, people who wish to purchase exquisite one of a kind musical pieces, as well as people who want to sell off their musical items. This project would benefit them greatly, as the affordability of our products allows people who are not so well off to also participate in this hobby. We also offer expert services to verify items sold to us would be authentic, so buyers can rest assured that items they purchase are 100% authentic. <p>
